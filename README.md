# Hey my name is Michael!

This pretty much is just a master list of every personal project I have ever fully completed or like, currently working on.
I was storing all of my projects on a personal hard drive, and I guess I wanted to learn the work flow of Git and well have an easier way to store my stuff.
So that is what brought me here!
